Job-Explorer (Frontend)

This is the front end for a web app that gets you the job openings for various companies. I used React.js to build the functionality for the all of the components.

You can view it here https://gaktines.github.io/job-explorer-frontend. It was built with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
